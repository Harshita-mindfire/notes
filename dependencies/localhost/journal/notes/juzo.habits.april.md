# April habits chart

This month we will focus on basic updrades in lifestyle. These are the changes I want to adapt ASAP.
I'll reward myself with a _mason jar_ if I have these hobbies at the end of this month.

## Develop

1. Read 1 article/blog everyday. Log it in your reading.
2. Hydrate yourself. Prepare a healthy drink everyday.

## Change

1. Decrease social media/sitting idle time to 2 hours a day.
2. Change body posture


## Restrospect
<!-->  Fill it at the end of month <!-->
Succeeded in 50% of the goals. Developed habit of hydrating. Didn't get enough lemons to continue making a lemonade everyday. Drank other drinks though(Cucumber water, buttermilk etc)
Decrease social media time. But increased netflix :(
Did change my body posture.

## Result
Not awarded with mason jar.
