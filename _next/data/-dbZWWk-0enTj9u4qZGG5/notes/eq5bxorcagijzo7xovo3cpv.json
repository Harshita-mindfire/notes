Initially it took me some time to get onboard. The frequent <em>sanskrit</em> names and references and a better vocabulary requirement kept me from turning pages but as I moved on from my inertia of reading thrillers, I fell in love with the narration. It torches light on why do we workship who we worship.\nP.S.
